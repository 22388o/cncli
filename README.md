# cncli

An admin command line control panel for cyphernode infrastructure.

## motivation

Cyphernode is a modular docker network that gives node operators a lot of flexibility in running their own bitcoin infrastructure as a docker network; with a focus on being small and safe. 

This flexibility can create a sharp learning curve for those who just want to run cyphernode out of the box with minimal customization.

cncli makes this task easy by keeping track of the entire project and data directory structure and providing all the basic admin tasks with an intuitive api.

## goal

The primary goal is to create a client tool that makes it easy for anyone to run a safe torified electrum personal server at home to use with their mobile wallets.
